# libft
In this first project of the core curriculum I implemented a library of essential functions in C.  
This project's primary objective is to foster a more profound understanding of these general prupose functions
 and to put them to use in further projects.

# usage

enter the directory

```
cd libft
make
```
compile your project with ft_printf, for example

```
cc main.c libft.a
```
you can use the functions of libft in your code now

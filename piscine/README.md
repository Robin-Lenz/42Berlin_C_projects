# Piscine

The 'Piscine' is a one-month assessment center of 42, a famous programming school with origins in France. During the Piscine, participants have the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in computer science and programming. It is an intense selection process in which candidates must tackle various challenges in the field of computer programming.

What makes 42 and its teaching concept unique is that they employ a peer-to-peer learning model, where students work largely independently and help each other. There are no formal teachers or lectures; instead, students are responsible for their own progress. This model is designed to promote problem-solving ability and creative thinking among students.

The Piscine serves as a kind of preparation for studying at 42. During the one-month program, participants can determine if they can adapt to this unique teaching approach and qualify for the challenges at 42. Those who successfully complete the Piscine have the opportunity to pursue regular education at 42, which extends over a longer period and is similarly intense.

These files represent my introduction to programming in C, and I haven't made any changes since then.

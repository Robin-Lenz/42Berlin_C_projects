# 42Berlin_C_projects

This repository contains all my projects from the core curriculum of 42 Berlin, implemented using the C programming language. These projects cover various topics and concepts in computer science and software engineering.
Projects:


libft:
	In this first project of the core curriculum I implemented a library of essential functions in C. This project's primary objective is to foster a more profound understanding of these general prupose functions
	
ft_printf:
	This is my implementation of printf with including the following conversions: cspdiuxX%.

get_next_line:
	This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

minitalk:
	The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

so_long:
	This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to get familiar with working with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

push_swap:
	This project involves sorting data using a stack and a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of actions required. Success requires proficiency in manipulating diverse algorithms and selecting the most suitable solution from a range of options for optimized data sorting.
	
philosophers:
	Eat, sleep, spaghetti, repeat! This project solves the dining philosopher problem using threads.

minishell:
	This project focuses on developing a basic shell, much alike a personalized version of bash. I learned a lot about processes and fle descriptors.

cub3D:
	This project draws inspiration from the renowned Wolfenstein 3D game, acknowledged as the pioneer of first-person shooters (FPS). It offers an opportunity to delve into ray-casting techniques. Its objective involved creating a dynamic view within a maze environment.


# Usage:

Clone the Repository:

    git clone git@github.com:Robin-Lenz/42Berlin_C_projects.git 42Berlin_C_projects

Compilation:
       Navigate to the directory of the specific project you want to inspect.
       Use the make command in your terminal to compile the code.
       Note: Some projects may have subdirectories, so ensure that you are in the correct directory containing the Makefile before executing the make command.

Program Usage:
       Each project contains a README file that provides instructions on how to use the program.
       Refer to the README file of the respective project for usage guidelines and program details.


Additional Information:

The second part of the curriculum, which focuses on C++, can be found in a separate repository named "42Berlin_projects_2".

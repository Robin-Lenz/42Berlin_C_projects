# 42Berlin_C_projects

This repository contains all the projects of the core curriculum of 42 Berlin written in C.

The second part of the curriculum is primarily written in C++ and can be found in my "42Berlin_projects_2" repository.




# usage

clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Robin-Lenz/42Berlin_C_projects.git 42Berlin_C_projects
```

Every project, except for "get_next_line", has a Makefile. To compile the code, navigate to the directory of the project you wish to inspect and type make in your terminal.

Be aware that certain projects may have subdirectories, so ensure that you are in the directory containing the Makefile before executing the make command.

Every project contains a README that describes how to use the program.
